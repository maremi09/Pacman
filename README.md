# Pacman Project

This project was a fun introduction into motion and animation in the browser. It taught me how to manipulate the confines of the browser in order to achieve an animation, albeit quite barebones.

The code in pacman.js allows for images to constantly change, resulting in the illusion of movement in one direction, which is then reversed once the edge of the browser window is reached.
